I was slightly annoyed with the strict filenaming rules for jekyll posts, as well as the weird header thing up top. 
I immediately started to wonder if there was a way to use obsidian to create jekyll markdowns 
Luckily, there are others who thought of (and documented) the same thing! https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow
