I'm trying to decide between jekyll and react for my github pages site. I'm looking for something that isn't totally hideous, somewhat customizable, and most importantly has low overhead. I considered writing html from scratch but it felt like a bit too much work to do by hand.

Jekyll - uses ruby, a language I'm not at all familiar with. It's a static site generator, which I also don't know much about except that it's recommended by Github.  
- you can customize the theme: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll 


React - there's a plugin called `gh-pages` that allows you to generate static-ish react for github pages.
